# Cooking-with-Logic

This is a Kaggle competition 'What's cooking?'

The competition gives us train and test datasets of different kinds of cuisines. Each row of the dataset gives us the name of the cuisine, an 'id' for the particular cuisins, and the ingrdients used in it. Once the model is trained for the name of the cuisine as dependent variable, we are required to predict the name for the ingredients list given in the test set.
